# githubusersrepo

The website would accept the name of a github user and show available repos for the user.
If you click on the repo's name, README.MD will be displayed. Design is not important. The project should use Typescript & ReactJs.

The project will be judged based on:

1. Project structure, architecture, good practices
2. Tools used
3. Code coverage
